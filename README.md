## Usage

### Download a single video

```bash
python downloader.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

### Download audio only

```bash
python downloader.py "https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --audio
```

### Batch download multiple videos

1. Create a text file (e.g., `urls.txt`) with one URL per line:
   ```
   https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID_1
   https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID_2
   https://vimeo.com/123456789
   ```

2. Run the batch download:
   ```bash
   python downloader.py --batch urls.txt
   ```

## Examples

```bash
# Download a YouTube video
python downloader.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"

# Extract audio from a music video
python downloader.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" --audio

# Download multiple videos from a list
python downloader.py --batch my_playlist.txt
```

## Output

Downloaded files are saved in the `downloads` folder (created automatically) with the video title as the filename.

## Troubleshooting

### "pip is not recognized"
Use `python -m pip install yt-dlp` instead

### "ffmpeg is not installed"
Either install ffmpeg (recommended) or the script will automatically fall back to a single format that doesn't require merging

### Download fails
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the URL is correct and accessible
- Some sites may have geographical restrictions
